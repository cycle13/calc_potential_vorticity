# calc_potential_vorticity
There are some issues needs to be addressed by this repository
(1) calc PV at 500hPa (reanalysis)
(2) calc PV at 500hPa (CAM model outputs/still not encounter this issue)
(3) calc vertical average of PV across 150-500hPa (reanalyais)
(4) calc vertical average of PV across 150-500hPa (CAM model outputs)
(5) include bash script to make the calculation of PV parallelly
